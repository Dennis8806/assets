    "description": "GETTY uses the Token to incentivize everyone to join and share, so that everyone can
benefit from co-building, co-ruling, and sharing.
GET tokens, as the GETTY community's negotiable proof of equity, are the foundation of
the GETTY platform's community governance.
GETTY mainly serves ordinary investors and provides high-quality institutional-level
financial services.
GET tokens carry the core value of the GETTY ecology, protect the value of users'
transactions in the form of insurance, and produce the value incentives.
Users can use BUSD to participate in purchasing GET investment insurance-based
products, and ordinary investors also have the opportunity to participate. In addition,
holders of GET tokens can enjoy the rights and interests, such as voting of key affairs
(DAO) and dividends.",
